### The Other Problem

![Tech Addition](assets/images/tech_addiction.png)

We have technology addiction.

---

### The Question

How can so many of us be addicted to technology, yet only a fraction are able to masterfully control it?

---

### The Proposal

![Drive people's free will by providing them with a game that teaches them technical skills while playing.](assets/images/proposal.png)

If people are going to be addicted to technology, let's direct that addiction to good use.

### Imagination Into Reality

![Sandcastle](assets/images/into_reality.png)

People enjoy creating things.

+++

### Prior Art

![Skyrim](assets/images/skyrim.png)

*Warcraft* and *The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim* have a steep learning curve, and so modding is typically done by more earnest fans.

+++

### Simplicity Is Best

![Minecraft](assets/images/minecraft.jpeg)

Minecraft is successful because it's simple for kids and adults to create.

+++

### Balance

![Sky Craft](assets/images/sky_craft.png)

The solution to aim for is somewhere in between &mdash; simple to mod, yet technically edifying.

---

### Plan

1. Implement a 2.5D multiplayer action player-vs-player game.
2. Modding as a first class concept.
3. Easy sharing with other players.
4. Provide high quality resources to encourage modding.

+++

### 2.5D Multiplayer PVP

* 2D Sprites (characters)

    You don't neet a powerful computer to run the game; people with basic computers can join.

* Multiplayer PVP games are fun.
* It doesn't take a prodigy to create 2D sprites.

    These can be created with free software such as Paint.NET, and Krita.

+++

### Modding

There are many modding variations, each training a different skill:

* **Sprites:** Graphical art.
* **Character behaviour:** Configuration and user experience.
* **Scripted AI:** Programming and troubleshooting.
