# Will - Pitch

Pitch presentation for the in-development 2.5D game, Will.

> In a time when digital technology is a commodity, it is suboptimal that there is a technological skills shortage whilst tech addiction is prevalent. This imbalance is driven by both the environment in which people live, and natural human behaviour to chase immediate pleasures.
>
> We propose a game that presents itself as a favourable environment for fun, and capitalize on people's innate desire to create and share, to create a self-driving system that facilitates learning of technical skills through modifications of the game. As much as possible, the game is designed such that prerequisites - software, hardware, and prior knowledge - are minimal.
